A Command Line Interface (CLI) for managing and interacting with testbeds and benchmarks.

The \mbox{\hyperlink{classDTDB__CLI}{DTDB\+\_\+\+CLI}} class provides a command line interface for users to interact with a system of testbeds, benchmarks, and scenarios. It provides an easy-\/to-\/use interface for creating, managing, and executing these components.

The class stores active testbed and benchmark information and has the capability to process and execute various commands input by the user. The following key functionalities are provided\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{classTestbed}{Testbed}} management\+: Users can create, select, list, and remove testbeds.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{classBenchmark}{Benchmark}} management\+: Within a selected testbed, users can create, select, list, and remove benchmarks, as well as load benchmark configurations.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{classScenario}{Scenario}} management\+: Within a selected benchmark, users can create, list, remove scenarios, and run scenarios with or without parameters.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The \mbox{\hyperlink{classDTDB__CLI}{DTDB\+\_\+\+CLI}} class utilizes a command processor to interpret and execute commands input by the user. These commands are tokenized and processed individually to perform the requested operation on the relevant component (\mbox{\hyperlink{classTestbed}{Testbed}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{classBenchmark}{Benchmark}}, or \mbox{\hyperlink{classScenario}{Scenario}}).

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The class does not directly manage the underlying details of the \mbox{\hyperlink{classTestbed}{Testbed}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{classBenchmark}{Benchmark}}, or \mbox{\hyperlink{classScenario}{Scenario}} objects, but instead delegates these tasks to the appropriate classes.
